I was talking with Mr. Bosh from 9:50 p.m. to 10:15 p.m., then go to bed around 10:25 p.m.
However, I am not willing to show you what Bosh and me had talked.

Bosh told me about this secret daughter.
He had a girlfriend and a child names Cindel after getting married. He told me Cindel
does not know anything about her father, she is just incidentally working for him.
