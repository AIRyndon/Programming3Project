Hi there, I did tell the police that I was in my own room at that moment. 
I am not willing to show you what Mr. Bosh and me had talked before I left the working room.

Be honest, Mr. Bosh told me about this secret daughter. 
He had a girlfriend and a child (Cindel) after getting married.
However, Cindel does not know a thing about her father. She is just incidentally working for him.
