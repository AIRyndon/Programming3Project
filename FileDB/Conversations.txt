Belinda:
I was in my room from 8:15 p.m.to 11:00 p.m. 
Ashton was helping me clean my room.
I have no ideas what was going on.
Sandy:
I was with him from 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m.
Yes I left the house, because he was so aggressive. 
I cannot believe the way he shouted at me when I just asked
for a little bit of money.
Ashton:
I've been having an affair with Belinda for a year.
We planned to inherit Bosh's assets by slowly making him forgetful 
from prolonged sedative use, but we don't want to kill him. 
I'm sure a sedative can't kill someone!
