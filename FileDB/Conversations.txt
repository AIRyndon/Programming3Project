Marcello:
I talked with Mr. Bosh from 9:50 p.m. to 10:15 p.m., then got to bed at around 10:25 p.m.
However, I don't want to tell you what we talked about.
Sandy:
I was with him from 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m.
Yes I left the house, because he was so aggressive. 
I cannot believe the way he shouted at me when I just asked
for a little bit of money.
Ashton:
I was the first person to see him dead, I then called the police at 11:03 p.m.
Bosh was in the working room from 5 p.m.
From 8:15 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., I was in his bedroom and helped his wife in cleaning it.
