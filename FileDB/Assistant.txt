I was the first person to see him dead, I then called the police at 11:03 p.m.
Bosh was in the working room from 5 p.m.
From 8:15 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., I was in his bedroom and helped his wife in cleaning it.

I've been having an affair with Belinda for a year.
We planned to inherit the Bosh's assets by slowly making him forgetful because of prolonged sedative use,
but I don't want to kill him. I'm sure a sedative can't kill someone!
