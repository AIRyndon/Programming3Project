I talked with Mr. Bosh from 9:50 p.m. to 10:15 p.m., then got to bed at around 10:25 p.m.
However, I don't want to tell you what we talked about.

Bosh told me about this secret daughter.
He had another woman while he was married, the child's name is Cindel.
He told me Cindel does not know anything about her father, 
she is just working for him.
