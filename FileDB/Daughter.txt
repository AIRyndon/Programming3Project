I was with him from 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m.
Yes I left the house, because he was so aggressive. 
I cannot believe the way he shouted at me when I just asked
for a little bit of money.

I did not kill him! Yes the cheesecake was poisoned and I planned to do it.
But I changed my mind and left the working room with my cheesecake. 
I ordered that maid to throw it away even.
Right after that I left the house, how can I be the murderer?
Furthermore, he was obviously dead because of the injury in his chest.
