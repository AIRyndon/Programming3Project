At around 8:15 p.m., Ashton left the working room to Bosh's bedroom. He and Belinda were so weird.
I was in my room talking with a friend, I think it was from 10:15 p.m. to 10:45 p.m.
The police officer told us he died at 10:30 p.m.

I saw Sandy return home with a cheesecake, then she went straight to Bosh's working room.
I don't know what happened but she was angry when she left.
I guess they had an argument, she is a gambling addict.
