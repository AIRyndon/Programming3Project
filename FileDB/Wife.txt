I was in my room from 8:15 p.m.to 11:00 p.m. Ashton was helping me clean my room.
Yes, I had given him sedatives for 6 months because he found it hard to sleep.

Ashton and I planned to inherit the Bosh's assets by slowly making him forgetful because of prolonged sedative use,
but I don't want to kill him. I'm sure a sedative can't kill someone!
