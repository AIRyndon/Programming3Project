I was with him from 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m.
If my father was not dead, I would not drive back home. He was so aggressive.
I cannot believe that he could shout at me when I ask him for some money.

No, I did not kill him! Yes the cheesecake was poisoned, 
but I already asked Cindel to throw it away.
I planned to, but I changed my mind and left the working room with my cheesecake.
Right then I get out of this house, how can I be a murderer?
