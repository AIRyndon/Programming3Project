Yeah, I was calling my friend at that time in my room. 
Thus, I can remember who was going in and out the working room before 10:20 p.m. 
First things first, Mr. Bosh was always in the working room from 5 p.m. 
At 8:15 p.m., Ashton left the working room to Mr. Bosh's bedroom. 
He and Belinda were so weird. 
Next, Calistar returned home with a cheesecake and brought it to the working room. 
I don't know what happened but she was angry after talking with him. 
I guess there was an argument. She is a gambling addict. 
Then, Mr. Bosh asked Marcello to come to his room by 10:15 p.m. 
I was in my room at 10:20 p.m.

No she did not gave me anything.
