I was calling my friend from 10:10 p.m. to 10:45 p.m. in my room.
The police officer told us he was dead at 10:30 p.m.
At 8:15 p.m., Ashton left the working room to Bosh's bedroom.
He and Belinda were so weird.

I saw Calistar returned home with a cheesecake and brought it to the working room.
I don't know what happened but she was angry after talking with him.
I guess there was an argument. She is a gambling addict.
